# Greedy Approach:

- Every step focuses on being the most optimized step possible to solving the problem at that iteration, like maximizing or minimizing a value.

- Follows local optimal choice for each step with intent of finding the global solution optimally

- **Applications**: 
    - Job sequence with deadline
    - Frational Knapsack
    - Djakstra's Algorithm
    - Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms

- Job Sequence with Deadline

Jobs        j1  j2  j3  j4  j5
Profit      19  100 27  25  15
Deadline    1   2   2   1   3

Jobs        j1    j2  j3   j4  j5
Profit      200  100 190  300  100
Deadline    1   2   2   1   3

Knapsack Capcity:
15
